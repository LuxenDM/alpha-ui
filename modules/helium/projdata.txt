Helium is an interface library for Vendetta Online. It is intended to assist in the construction of more advanced, feedback-heavy interfaces, with light asyncronous options available





file map:
	
	helium.lua
		primary core of helium library, loads individual branches
		
	utilfunc.lua
		contains utility functions that make helium work
		
	async.lua
		contains basic async interface controls. Not dependent on MercuryLib's async or tasker functions
		
	primitives
		contains the 'simple' iup structures and presets, like clear frames, cover buttons, etc
		
	constructs
		contains the iup structures and presets that are made of multiple interactive elements. Functions to control parts should be found in the root node
		
		contruct_frames
			contains the contruct features related to expansive frames, scrollers, and reactive tabs
			
		construct_misc
			contains the generalized items for constructs
		
	gui_presets
		contains complete dialogs to be used by other plugins
		
	color_picker
		contains the color picker dialog, as well as the paint/color select and panel constructs. load after dragdrop.
	
	dragdrop
		contains the drag_item/drag_target constructs.

paintselect/colorselect only show the current color (or a default), and a button to open a color_dialog to pick a new color. If opened by a paintselect, the rgb tab will be disabled.

the paint/color panels show a static color, and provides feedback when clicked. the user can initiate a drag action from a panel to drop their respective color somewhere.
